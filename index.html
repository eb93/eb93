		<div>Hi! I’m Eliza and I’d like to be your new Digital and Social Content Producer</div>

		<div>You’re hired!</div>
		<div>Here’s a little about me!</div>
		<div>I have a Bachelor’s degree in Communications: Media Arts and Production from UTS and have completed further study in SEO and Facebook Marketing with the University of Sydney’s Centre for Continuing Education.

I’m a team player that will happily share the workload of my teammates to get the job done. It was this attitude that saw me earn a permanent position and promotion within 6 months of starting as Digital Producer at Refraction Media.

Digital content and marketing are my bread and butter. My skills in content creation, digital marketing and campaign management saw Refraction Media’s traffic grow by 300% in my first year of employment.

I’m an eternal learner. I’m always looking for ways to upskill on the job; whether that’s by learning from my coworkers or volunteering for a new task to practice skills outside of my job description.

		<div>I love developing creative solutions to sales-driven content that doesn’t read like a sales pitch.</div>
		<div>I’m specialised in developing content across different digital mediums to satisfy both editorial and sponsored briefs.
In my latest role with Refraction Media, I was Digital Producer and managed all content delivered on our websites, eDMs, social media and marketing platforms.

This includes:
- Editorial and sponsored articles
- Filmed interview & video content
- Animation scriptwriting & storyboarding
- Marketing copy & digital marketing campaigns
- Sponsored & editorial eDMs
- Content with adaptable ‘voice’ and brand messaging for diverse clientele

		<div>I’m a digital marketing whiz! It was my job to manage all Refraction Media’s digital sponsorships, and I’m pretty proud of the results.</div>
		<div>Before I started working with Refraction Media, there was no such thing as a digital-only sponsorship. Through the use of SEO, social media, digital marketing and content creation, I grew the company’s digital platforms by 300%. That meant we could start advertising sponsorships solely through our digital platforms, introducing a brand new revenue stream to the business.

Managing these digital-only campaigns was my job; from interpreting the brief and liaising with the client to develop content, to putting the content online and using organic and paid marketing campaigns to drive engagement.

These campaigns remain to be the most popular articles on CareerswithSTEM.com, and even generated our best-ever traffic week on the site. A whopping 15k viewers visited during the opening week of our Bragg Student Writing Prize delivered on behalf of UNSW Press, compared to a usual 6-8k viewers per week.
